                    I am Abhijith. I am a carefree fellow who is lazy as hell. Wow, well that isn't how you start your 'About' page, but who cares. TAs told content wouldn't be judged, so why not type my heart out in here?  

                    I can sleep for days and can forgo taking a bath for weeks. Well these are actually skills you see? Well do not worry. I have a pretty cool deo with me cause when you TAs want to call and screw my case, you people needn't be afraid. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Okay now jokes apart...  Hope TAs read beyond this point.

                    I am Abhijith, yet again.
                    I hail from Trivandrum in Kerala. I love that place and it has a special place in my heart. I did my schooling till the 3rd grade there and those are the memories I will cherish throughout my life. Oh yeah! 
                </p>
                <p>

                    We are a family of four. My mom and dad both Engineers and a little sister who is 5 years younger than me. I am quite attached to my relatives too. Especially my grandparents.

                    And it was in 4th when my dad who lived in Abu Dhabi felt like taking us there. Guess he missed seeing my sister. :/ xD Anyway we all moved into Abu Dhabi which became my home for the next 10 years. 
                    Trust me, Abu Dhabi is the Shiz.Habibi.

                    I love making friends and going out and having fun :D I like playing chess too. And let me brag now, I was fortunate to represent the Gulf in the CBSE national Chess for 3 years. Nationals were the best time of out school life. Love my chess gang.

                    And in 2015, my whole life took a very different turn and I got the privilege to study Computer Science Engineering in one of the leading institutes of the country. So yeah moved in to OBH of IIIT campus. Its been memorable till now, hope it gets better in the coming 4 years.
